        description: "This search result from Orbit Media, which appeared for the search term “SEO best practice”, stood out as one of the only results on the page that didn’t appear to be auto-generated. While auto-generated Google meta descriptions can often be quite good, they tend to be truncated and don’t always read as a coherent summary of the page. Ironically, this result ranked just above one from Google Webmasters, which was itself truncated (it just goes to show that even Google doesn’t always get it right!)"

        description: "This meta description from Cambridge Dictionary, appearing for the search term “online dictionary”, is simple but effective: it sets out what differentiates the brand from its competitors (namely, that it is popular with people learning English) and then follows it with a description of what the brand has to offer (definitions of words, pronunciations, and translations)."

        title: " Merriam-Webster",
        description: "Merriam-Webster takes a different tack to the Cambridge Dictionary, branding itself as the most trusted online dictionary rather than the most popular. The meta description is short and impactful, and ends with Merriam-Webster’s signature hashtag, #wordsmatter."
